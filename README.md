# vue-intermediate

> Learning VueJS by Coding Along with Instructor.  Certain parts were given to me by instructor. JavaScript code was written by me to practice what I have learned so far.

> This App shows a List of Servers. Some Stable. Some not so Stable... When loaded all Non stable Servers will be highlighted Red and stable servers will be labeled Green.  When you click on a Server, Details will be Displayed on the right, showing the status of the server. There will be a Button when clicked it will make the server Stable. In doing this the css is changed to Display the server Highlighted in Green.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install
